- create columns for platforms and select a random one for spawn
- fix movement physics
- add art
- make mobile-compatible
- package using phonegap

Done - get a more even x distribution for platform spawns
Done - implement score
Done - add game states (so that player starts on platform in the middle of the screen instead of on the ground)
Done - add collision with top of platforms (find a way to narrow collision detection to closest platform)
Done - add platforms
    Done - add custom image object
Done - Prevent player from moving out of the left and right of the screen

Issues:



(fixed)
1. if players velocity is higher than height of platform he falls through it (fix)
2. Fix for above problem causes a gap between player and platform which is equal to player yvelocity at the time of collision detection
3. player can still jump after they've died
4. sometimes player falls through platforms - not sure why
