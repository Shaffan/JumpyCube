- add game states (so that player starts on platform in the middle of the screen insteaf of on the ground)
- fix physics
    = if players velocity is higher than height of platform he falls through it (fix)
- add momentum if player is in the air ( should add friction all the time and then have reduced friction while in the air)

Done - add collision with top of platforms (find a way to narrow collision detection to closest platform)
Done - add platforms
    Done - add custom image object
Done - Prevent player from moving out of the left and right of the screen



Eventually

- create game engine based on this game
