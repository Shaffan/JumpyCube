- add collision with top of platforms
- add game states (so that player starts on platform in the middle of the screen insteaf of on the ground)
- add momentum if player is in the air ( should add friction all the time and then have reduced friction while in the air)


Done - add platforms
    Done - add custom image object
Done - Prevent player from moving out of the left and right of the screen



Eventually
